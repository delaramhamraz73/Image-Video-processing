# Image and Video Enhancement

This program is made to perform image and video enhancement.
It takes in an image that the user chooses and apply high pass filters (Canny, Laplacian, Sobel) or low pass filters (Box blur, blur, Gaussian blur) on it.
It will give the ability to the user to save the enhanced picture. 
It will also apply the sobel filter on live webcam video. 
The basic goal of this program is to process the image so that we can view and assess the visual information it contains with greater clarity.
Image Enhancement, therefore, is rather subjective because it depends strongly on the specific information the user is hoping to extract from the image.

## Appendix

**Enhancement via image filtering**
The main goal of image enhancement is to process an image in some way so as to render it 
more visually acceptable or pleasing. The removal of noise, the sharpeningof image edges and the 'soft focus' (bluring)
effect so often favoured in romantic photographs are all examples of popular enhancement techniques.
These and other enhancement operations can be achieved through the process of spatial domain filtering. 
Spatial domain filtering simply indicates that the filtering process takes place directly on the actual pixels of the image itself.
